	abstract = {Even though neural networks enjoy widespread use, they still struggle to learn the basic laws of physics. How might we endow them with better inductive biases? In this paper, we draw inspiration from Hamiltonian mechanics to train models that learn and respect exact conservation laws in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate our models on problems where conservation of energy is important, including the two-body problem and pixel observations of a pendulum. Our model trains faster and generalizes better than a regular neural network. An interesting side effect is that our model is perfectly reversible in time.},

	abstract = {Hybrid machine learning based on Hamiltonian formulations has recently been successfully demonstrated for simple mechanical systems, both energy conserving and not energy conserving. We introduce a pseudo-Hamiltonian formulation that is a generalization of the Hamiltonian formulation via the port-Hamiltonian formulation, and show that pseudo-Hamiltonian neural network models can be used to learn external forces acting on a system. We argue that this property is particularly useful when the external forces are state dependent, in which case it is the pseudo-Hamiltonian structure that facilitates the separation of internal and external forces. Numerical results are provided for a forced and damped mass-spring system and a tank system of higher complexity, and a symmetric fourth-order integration scheme is introduced for improved training on sparse and noisy data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14374},
	abstract = {Pseudo-Hamiltonian neural networks (PHNN) were recently introduced for learning dynamical systems that can be modelled by ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we extend the method to partial differential equations. The resulting model is comprised of up to three neural networks, modelling terms representing conservation, dissipation and external forces, and discrete convolution operators that can either be learned or be given as input. We demonstrate numerically the superior performance of PHNN compared to a baseline model that models the full dynamics by a single neural network. Moreover, since the PHNN model consists of three parts with different physical interpretations, these can be studied separately to gain insight into the system, and the learned model is applicable also if external forces are removed or changed.},
